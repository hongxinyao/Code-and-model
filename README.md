# Code-and-model
"filter1", "filter2","heat_flux","dt_iteration" and "Thermal_imager" are conducted using custom code in MATLAB (MathWorks)
"filter1" and "filter2" are used to filter the noise of temperature history of each monitoring point.
"heat_flux" is used to design the target heat flux field.
"dt_iteration" is used to analyze the target heat flux field to obtain the dwell duration distribution and scaned the heat flux field.
"Thermal_imager" is used to extract thermal image data.
"model55" is the water-cooling plate simulation model based on COMSOL 5.5, including geometry, material properties and all solution settings.
